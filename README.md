# CV Chatbot Website
This projects builds on my CLI CV Chatbot found at this link:
https://github.com/dlbjcksn82/CLI_CV_Chatbot

The goal is to turn the chatbot into a flask app that can run on  my website and used as a way to provide potential employers more information about me.

For instance, while I send them a small CV tailored to the job, I can use the chatbot to provide extra information about those jobs and other experiences and hobbies I have.
